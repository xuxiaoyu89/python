'''
Given two arrays of length m and n with digits 0-9 representing two numbers. 
Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two. 
The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved. 
Return an array of the k digits. 
You should try to optimize your time and space complexity.
